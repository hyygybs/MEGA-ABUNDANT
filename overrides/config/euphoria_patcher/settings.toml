# This file stores configuration options for the Euphoria Patcher mod
# Made for version 1.8.2
# Thank you for using Euphoria Patches - SpacEagle17

[display]
	# Option for the sodium message popup logging.
	# Default = true
	doPopUpLogging = true

	# Option that enables or disables the in-game shader messages, for example an update message made by the shader itself. Only works on Iris or Oculus
	# Default = true
	doDisplayShaderInGameMessage = true

[updates]
	# Option which determines what updates the update checker considers.
	# Update checker mode: 'important' (critical or big updates only), 'all' (all updates), 'none' (disabled).
	# Uses the Modrinth API to fetch update information.
	# Default = important
	doUpdateChecking = "important"

[maintenance]
	# Option that automatically renames outdated Euphoria Patches folders and config files to a new name.
	# This makes it easier for users to identify which ones are outdated.
	# Default = true
	doRenameOldShaderFiles = true

	# Option that automatically deletes outdated Euphoria Patches folders and config files.
	# Default = false
	doDeleteOldShaderFiles = false

[debug]
	# Option that enables or disables debug logging. Alternatively, one can also set the JVM argument -DebugEP=true/false which takes priority over this setting.
	# Default = false
	doDebugLogging = false

[advanced]
	# Here one can set alternative Shader Names which will also be generated alongside the normal one.
	# This is useful if you want multiple different settings you can quickly switch between
	# Default = Empty String, which means no alternative names will be generated.
	# In case of multiple names, separate them with a comma
	# You can also use {baseVersion} or {patchVersion} in names to insert the base shader or Euphoria Patches version.
	# Example: Euphoria Saturated, Comp_{baseVersion} + EP_{patchVersion} Dark Settings, EP High Performance, etc...
	alternativeShaderNames = ""
